<h1 style="text-align:center;">Mathematical Physics Mini Seminar Series</h1>

<hr>
<p>In February 2018 we decided to start a mini series of seminars for PhD students within the mathematical physics group here at Heriot-Watt. The idea was to introduce the other PhD students to topics that we were interested in and that are, possibly, related to our research.</p>
<p>The idea is that starting on Thursday 8/2 we will meet in T.01 at 4:30pm, after tea time though this is flexible.</p>
<p>The schedule below is provisional and is fairly likely to change.</p>

	<td>Non-Associativity in quantum mechanics arising from smooth distributions of magnetic charge</td>
	<td>Canonical quantization of a charged particle in the background of a magnetic field with sources on $\mathbb{R}^3$ is possible only if the sources are localised at isolated points in space and Dirac's charge quantization condition is satisfied. In this case wave functions can be realised as sections of a non trivial line bundle.Otherwise the algebra of operators becomes non-associative and there is no way to represent it on a Hilbert space. In this talk we propose to represent it instead on a 2-Hilbert space of sections of a bundle gerbe.To support this proposal we explicitly construct the action of magnetic translation operators on this 2-Hilbert space. In the case of uniform magnetic charge our construction reproduces known results from deformation quantisation. The categorical structures involved naturally encode the 3-cocycle measuring the non-associativity of the representation. This approach to a basic, but yet unsolved physical problem provides an enriched view on quantum mechanics, and we conclude this talk with a short discussion of the questions it poses regarding its physical interpretation.   This is joint work in progress with Severin Bunk and Richard J. Szabo. </td>

	<td>Calum Ross</td>
	<td>Spectral curves and Monopoles </td>
	<td>I will try and sketch the construction of the spectral curve of a monopole for gauge group $SU(2)$, maybe $SU(n)$ if I have time. To do this we will encounter Euclidean monopoles, their twistor space and how to extract algebrogeometric data from this construction. The talk will be roughly based on these <a href= "http://www2.macs.hw.ac.uk/~cdr1/notes/monopoles_and_spectral_curves.pdf"> notes<a> and the references therein. <font color="blue">In the end we did not get to talking about the spectral curve but did see most of the details of the twistor space construction and a sketch of how it relates to the twistor space of instantons in four dimensions.</font></td>

	<td>Iain Findlay</td>
	<td>Integrable Defects in the Liouville Model</td>
	<td>N.B. This is on a Friday as it is jointly a PhD seminar. The core of this talk will be the Lax construction of the Liouville model, and the idea of integrable defects in this picture. Combining these two ideas, I will example the effects of the presence of an integrable defect on the Liouville model, comparing it to the effect of a B채cklund transformation frozen at a specific point in space, and how we can use these to find a solution to the Liouville equation. Based off of the work: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04237"> https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04237</a></td>
