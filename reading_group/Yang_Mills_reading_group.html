<h1 style="text-align:center;">The Yang-Mills Equations over Riemann Surfaces Reading group 2020.</h1>

<hr>
<p>This is a page of information about the reading group for the Atiyah and Bott paper "The Yang-Mills Equations over Riemann Surfaces".</p>
<p>The reading group grew out of the PhD reading groups run through the Heriot-Watt Mathematical Physics group which most of the participants were members of. </p>
<p>We will decide on a reasonable number of pages to read each week, probably content dependent but likely to be under 10. </p>
<p>The participants include: Calum Ross (me) UCC, Lukas Müller MPI Bonn, Lennart Schmidt NUS, ....</p>

<p> The page <a target="_blank" href="http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahjde/yangmills.htm"> here,</a> is for a course which covered some of the same details and may be a useful resource and source of further references.</p>
