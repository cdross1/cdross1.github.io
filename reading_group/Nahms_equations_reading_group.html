<h1 style="text-align:center;">Nahm's Equations and HyperK&auml;hler Quotient Constructions Reading Group 2022.</h1>

<hr>
<p>This is a page of information about the reading group Nahm's equations and infinite dimensional hyperk&auml;hler quotient constructions.</p>
<p>The idea is that we will learn about infinite dimensional quotient discussions by studying some examples. The example that we will focus on first is that of Nahm's equations following the lecture notes by Maxence Mayrand found <a href="https://www.math.toronto.edu/mayrand/nahm-lectures.pdf" >here</a>. These notes and other potentially useful references are linked at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>We will meet between 13:30 and 15:00 in room 707. </p>
<p>Participants: Jaime Mendizabal, Enric Sole Farre, Andries Salam, Jakob Stein, Benjamin Aslan, Nico Cavalleri, Calum Ross, ...</p>
<p>Rough notes of what we have discussed will be periodically updated <a href= "https://cdross1.github.io/notes/nahm_equations_reading_group_notes.pdf"> here<a>.</p>

	<td>We had a brief chat about how we would proceed with the reading group. It was a housekeeping session where we discussed how to proceed. We have decided to aim for 1 hour sessions, 13:30-15:00 UK time , with ~30-45 minutes for a presentation and the rest of the time for a discussion. The plan is for the presenter to change each week though there is no obligation to volunteer.</td>

	<td>We discussed some general motivation of where these quotients show up, e.g. when considering the physical configurations of a theory. Then we met instantons and their dimensional reductions before focussing on the case of Nahm's equations and some examples of solutions for SU(2).</td>
