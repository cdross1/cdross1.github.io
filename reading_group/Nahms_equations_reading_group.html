<h1 style="text-align:center;">Nahm's Equations and HyperK&auml;ler Quotient Constructions Reading Group 2022.</h1>

<hr>
<p>This is a page of information about the reading group Nahm's equations and infinite dimensional hyperk&auml;hler quotient constructions.</p>
<p> The idea is that we will learn about infinite dimensional quotient discussions by studying some examples. The example that we will focus on first is that of Nahm's equations following the lecture notes by Maxence Mayrand found <a href="https://www.math.toronto.edu/mayrand/nahm-lectures.pdf" >here</a>. </p>
<p> The page <a target="_blank" href="http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahjde/yangmills.htm"> here,</a> is for a course which covered the paper by Atiyah and Bott "The Yang-Mills Equations over Riemann Surfaces", which considers the Yang-Mills equations over Riemann surfaces and discusses some details about their moduli spaces. It may be a useful resource and source of further references.</p> 
<p>Participants: Jaime Mendizabal,  </p>

	<td>We had a brief chat about how we would proceed with the reading group. It was a housekeeping session where we discussed how to proceed. We have decided to aim for 1 hour sessions, 13:30-15:00 UK time , with ~30-45 minutes for a presentation and the rest of the time for a discussion. The plan is for the presenter to change each week though there is no obligation to volunteer.</td>
