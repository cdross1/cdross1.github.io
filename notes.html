<h2>Reading Groups</h2>
<p>At various points during my PhD and afterwards, I have been both an organiser and a participant in reading groups on a variety of topics. For several of these reading groups I maintained a webpage with a record of what was discussed and ocassionally a set of notes.</p>
<p>January 2017 - September 2017: I organised a reading group on String Theory and D-Branes following Richard J. Szabo. An Introduction to String Theory and D-Brane Dynamics (With Problems and Solutions). ICP, 2 edition, 2011. Notes from this reading group are included in the notes section below.</p>
<p>October 2017 - January 2018: I participated in a reading group renormalisation and effective field theories following the book by Costello. Following this reading group we decided to start a short seminar series, the details of which are  <a href="https://cdross1.github.io/mpmss">here</a>.  </p>
<p>October 2018 - March 2019: I organised a reading group on Statistical Field Theory following David Tongs Lecture <a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/sft.html"> notes</a> .  </p>
<p>The reading group moved online in 2020 and I started to participate again.</p>
<p>October 2020 - April 2021: I organised a reading group on Yang-Mills Equations over Riemann Surfaces following the seminal paper by Atiyah and Bott. A partial webpage for this reading group is available <a href="https://cdross1.github.io/reading_group/Yang_Mills_reading_group">here</a>. </p>
<p>June 2022-July 2022: I was involved in a reading group on Nahm's equations and hyperk&auml;hler quotient constructions. A partial webpage is available <a href="https://cdross1.github.io/reading_group/Nahms_equations_reading_group">here</a>.</p>
<p>October 2022- March 2023: I am involved in a reading group about Instantons on gravitational instantions following the paper by Kronheimer and Nakajima. A rough webpage for the reading group is available <a href="https://cdross1.github.io/reading_group/Instantons_on_gravitational_instantons_reading_group">here</a>.</p>


<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Here are a selection of notes that I made to remind myself about interesting topics that I started reading about. N.B some of the links might be dead as I have migrated files from my Heriot Watt webpage.<p>
<ul>
	<li><a href= "https://cdross1.github.io/notes/moment_maps.pdf"> Notes<a> on moment maps and the Hyperk&aumlhler structure of the moduli space of solutions to Hitchin's Self-duality equations. </li>
	<li><a href="https://cdross1.github.io/notes/strings_reading_group_notes.pdf"> Notes</a> on String Theory relating to the reading group we are having. The plan was that everyone would contribute to these notes but in the end it was just me. There are a couple of gaps where I did not have time to tex up some of the computations that we discussed.</li>
	<li><a href="https://cdross1.github.io/notes/membrane_dynamics-talk.pdf"> Notes</a> for a talk I gave on classical bosonic membrane dynamics as part of our D-Brane reading group. </li>
	<li><a href= "https://cdross1.github.io/notes/rational_maps.pdf"> Notes<a> on rational maps that I made to remind myself of their properties and relation to vortices. </li> 
	<li> <a href= "http://personal.maths.surrey.ac.uk/st/M.Wolf/" >Martin Wolf </a> from the university of Surrey gave a short introductory course on Twistor theory at Heriot-Watt from 27/11/17-30/11/17. The lectures contained many exercises and some of us spent some time solving them. The exercises and our sketch solutions are <a href= "https://cdross1.github.io/notes/twistor_exercises.pdf"> here<a>.
	<li>Some  <a href= "https://cdross1.github.io/notes/monopoles_and_spectral_curves.pdf"> notes</a> on Monopoles, mini-twistors and spectral curves that I made ( am still making) while reading papers about the topics so that I could keep some conventions to hand. </li>
