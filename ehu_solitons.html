<h1 style="text-align:center;">Topological Solitons at Edge Hill</h1>

<hr>
<!--<img src="photo.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400">-->
<p>On July 10th 2024 I will host a one day event about topological solitons at <a href ="https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/" >Edge Hill University</a> funded by an <a href ="https://www.lms.ac.uk/">LMS</a> celebrating new appointments grant. The day will consist of four talks about topological solitons and related topics. More details will be added once they have been confirmed.</p>


<h2>Confirmed participants </h2> 
<p>The invited speakers are </p>
<ul>
	<li>Guido Franchetti, University of Bath</li>
	<li>Derek Harland, Unversity of Leeds </li>
	<li>Tom Winyard, University of Edinburgh</li>	
</ul>  
<p>If you would like to attend please fill out the form at <a href ="https://forms.office.com/e/uT2pQV9Dqw">https://forms.office.com/e/uT2pQV9Dqw</a>, registration for the event is free. If there are any questions the please send me an email at calum.ross[at]edgehill[dot]ac[dot]uk, there is, very, limited funding available to cover some transport costs for speakers and any PhD students who wish to attend. Please get in touch if you would like ask about this support. </p>

<h2>Rough Program</h2>
<p> The full program will be confirmed nearer the time a rough outline is included below. All the talks will be held in the Tech Hub lecture theatre THG08. There will be a lunch provided at 13:00 in the Tech Hub foyer, and after the talks anyone who is staying in Ormskirk for the evening can go for dinner </p>
<!--elcome from head of department. Talk 1 - Dr Calum Ross (Edge Hill University) 
Lunch. Talk 2 - Dr Tom Winyard (University of Edinburgh). 
Talk 3 - Internal speaker to be confirmed. Coffee break. 
Talk 4 - Dr Derek Harland (University of Leeds). 
Talk 5 - Dr Guido Franchetti (University of Bath). 
Wrap up. If I cannot confirm the second internal speaker then there would just be 4 talks with the coffee break still taking place between talks 3 and 4.-->

	<td>Harmonic Spinors on K&auml;hler Manifolds</td>
	<td>Harmonic spinors, that is solutions of the massless Dirac equation, have been the object of considerable interest from both the mathematical and physical communities. In the talk I will show how the rich structure of Kähler manifolds allows to recast the Dirac equation in a way which makes obtaining explicit solutions easier. The method will be applied to the Eguchi-Hanson manifold, for which we show how to reproduce known solutions, and to more general  Ricci-flat Kähler manifolds obtained via the Calabi construction, for which we present new solutions.</td>
