<p>I am a mathematical physicist with an interest in topological solitons, particularly integrable vortices and magnetic skyrmions. Further details about my current and previous directions of research can be found on my <a href="https://cdross1.github.io/research">research page</a>. </p>
<p>Currently, I am a Lecturer in Physics within the <a href ="https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/departments/academic/computerscience/">Computer Science</a> and <a href ="https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/departments/academic/engineering/">Enigineering</a> Department at Edge Hill University. My University research page is available <a href ="https://research.edgehill.ac.uk/en/persons/calum-ross">here</a>. </p>
<!--<p>Since September 2023 I have been a Lecturer in Physics within the Computer Science Department at <a href ="https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/departments/academic/computerscience/">Edge Hill University</a>. My role at Edge Hill involves designing and developing a physics degree alongside colleagues in the engineering department.</p>-->
<p>Before joining Edge Hill, I was a Research Felow at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/"> University College London </a> within <a href= "http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahlfo/Home.html">Lorenzo Foscolo's</a> group in the Mathematics department.
Prior to that, I was a special purpose Lecturer in Physics at <a href="https://www.ucc.ie/en/"> University College Cork</a> for the 2020-2021 academic year. Details of the modules that I taught while at UCC or on my <a href="https://cdross1.github.io/teaching">teaching page</a>.
During 2019-2020, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/keiotopsci/ "> Topological Sciences</a> group at Keio university. While in Japan I primarily worked on magnetic solitons, particularly questions about the interaction of magnetic skyrmions and the phase diagram of chiral magnets. I am still affiliated with Keio University as a visiting researcher.</p>


<p>I did my PhD student in the mathematical physics group at Heriot-Watt University under the supervison of <a href ="https://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~bernd/">Bernd Schroers</a>. While in Edinburgh I was an active member of the <a href="https://empg.maths.ed.ac.uk">Edinburgh Mathematical Physics Group.</a> I have an MPhys in Theoretical Physics from Lancaster University and a MASt in Applied Mathematics from the University of Cambridge.
At Lancaster I did a Master's project on Physical Applications of Products of Geometric Distributions and while at Cambridge I wrote a Part III Essay on the Geometry of Supersymmetric and Super-Conformal Quantum Mechanics.</p>
<!--<p>During the academic years 2016-2017 and  2017-2018 I organised the PhD student seminar series within MACS at Heriot-Watt. This is a weekly informal seminar series held in CM/T.01 on Fridays, offering PhD students to present their work or a topic that they are interested in to their peers.</p>-->


<h3>Solitons at Work </h3>
<p>The <a href = "http://solitonsatwork.net/?">Solitons at Work</a> network is an online community of researchers working on all things solitons. Since 2022 I have been a member of the organising committe and have helped to run the the online seminar series. Recordings of most of the talks are available on the <a href = "http://solitonsatwork.net/?display=seminars">seminar page</a>.  </p>

<!-- <h3>Supervision</h3> <p> If you are interested in doing a PhD or MRes with me the please get in touch. Edge Hill University has a <a href ="https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/departments/support/graduateschool/graduate-positions/">GTA</a> scheme to fund PhD students. Broadly I am interested in topics related to topological solitons and whould be happy to supervise work on solitons in chiral magnets, the geometry of soliton moduli spaces, integrable vortices, instantons on gravitational instantons. </p> -->

<h3> Chalkdust</h3>
<p><a href ="https://chalkdustmagazine.com/">Chalkdust</a> is a magazine for the mathematically curious featuring articles written by mathematics enthusiast from all over the world. It is agreat magazine and I recommend that you check it out, though I may be biased as a member of the team that produces it.</p>

<h3>Other Interests </h3>
<p>As you can probably tell from all the photos on this page I am a keen hillwalker and climber. I can also often be found out cycling. </p>
