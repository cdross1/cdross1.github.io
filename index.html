<p>I am a Research Felow at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/"> University College London </a> within <a href= "http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahlfo/Home.html">Lorenzo Foscolo's</a> group in the Mathematics department.</p>
<p>My research interests relate to Topological Solitons and their links to geometry, Differential Geometry and Gauge Theory. In particular my PhD work focused on studying a geometric interpretation of integrable vortex equations. I have continued working on this as well as studying the relationship between vortices and BPS monopoles. More recently I have worked on solvable models of magnetic skyrmions, as well as domain walls in one dimensional chiral magnets.</p>
<p>Before joining UCL I was a temporary Lecturer in Physics at <a href="https://www.ucc.ie/en/"> University College Cork</a> for the 2020-2021 academic year. In the first semester I taught PY2101 Classical Mechanics, in the second semester I taught PY3104 Statistical Thermodynamics and part of PY4126 Radiative Processes.</p>
<p>In 2019-2020  I was a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/keiotopsci/ "> Topological Sciences</a> group at Keio university. While in Japan I primarily worked on magnetic solitons, particularly questions about the interaction of magnetic skyrmions and the phase diagram of chiral magnets.</p>


<p>I did my PhD student in the mathematical physics group at Heriot-Watt University under the supervison of Bernd Schroers. While in Edinburgh I was a member of the <a href="https://empg.maths.ed.ac.uk">Edinburgh Mathematical Physics Group.</a> I have an MPhys in Theoretical Physics from Lancaster University and a MASt in Applied Mathematics from the University of Cambridge.
At Lancaster I wrote a Master's project on Physical Applications of Products of Geometric Distributions and while at Cambridge I wrote a Part III Essay on the Geometry of Supersymmetric and Super-Conformal Quantum Mechanics.</p>
<p>During the academic years 2016-2017 and  2017-2018 I organised the PhD student seminar series within MACS at Heriot-Watt. This is a weekly informal seminar series held in CM/T.01 on Fridays, offering PhD students to present their work or a topic that they are interested in to their peers.</p>
<!--- For the academic year 2018-2019 <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ace2/">Alex Evetts</a> has taken over organising them. The talks are sometimes advertised <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/students/pgr/news-events/">here</a> and a record of previous talks as well as upcoming talks is <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~ace2/phd_seminar.html">here</a>.</p>--->
<!---<p> Between January and September 2017 I participated in a reading group on String Theory and D-Branes. A webpage for the reading group is <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~cdr1/String_reading_group">here</a>.</p>-->
<!---<p> From October 2017 until January 2018 there was a reading group running on renormalisation and effective field theories. Following this reading group we decided to start a short seminar series, the details of which are  <a href="https://cdross1.github.io/mpmss">here</a>.</p>-->
<!---<p>In October 2018 we started a reading group on statistical field theory which ran until March 2019. A webpage for the reading group is <a href="http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~cdr1/sft">here</a>.</p>-->

<h3>Reading Groups</h3>
<p>While a PhD student at Heriot-Watt I was invloved as an organiser and a participant in a variety of reading groups.</p>
<p>January 2017 - September 2017: I organised a reading group on String Theory and D-Branes following Richard J. Szabo. An Introduction to String Theory and D-Brane Dynamics (With Problemsand Solutions). ICP, 2 edition, 2011. Notes from this reading group are included in the notes section below.</p>
<p>October 2017 - January 2018: I participated in a reading group renormalisation and effective field theories following the book by Costello. Following this reading group we decided to start a short seminar series, the details of which are  <a href="https://cdross1.github.io/mpmss">here</a>.  </p>
<p>October 2018 - March 2019: I organised a reading group on Statistical Field Theory following David Tongs Lecture <a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/sft.html"> notes</a> .  </p>
<p>The reading group moved online in 2020 and I started to participate again.</p>
<p>October 2020 - April 2021: I organised a reading group on Yang-Mills Equations over Riemann Surfaces following the seminal paper by Atiyah and Bott. A partial webpage for this reading group is available <a href="https://cdross1.github.io/reading_group/Yang_Mills_reading_group">here</a>. </p>


<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Here are a selection of notes that I made to remind myself about interesting topics that I started reading about. N.B some of the links might be dead as I have migrated files from my Heriot Watt webpage.<p>
<ul>
	<li><a href= "https://cdross1.github.io/notes/moment_maps.pdf"> Notes<a> on moment maps and the Hyperk&aumlhler structure of the moduli space of solutions to Hitchin's Self-duality equations. </li>
	<li><a href="https://cdross1.github.io/notes/strings_reading_group_notes.pdf"> Notes</a> on String Theory relating to the reading group we are having. The plan was that everyone would contribute to these notes but in the end it was just me. There are a couple of gaps where I did not have time to tex up some of the computations that we discussed.</li>
	<li><a href="https://cdross1.github.io/notes/membrane_dynamics-talk.pdf"> Notes</a> for a talk I gave on classical bosonic membrane dynamics as part of our D-Brane reading group. </li>
	<li><a href= "https://cdross1.github.io/notes/rational_maps.pdf"> Notes<a> on rational maps that I made to remind myself of their properties and relation to vortices. </li> 
	<li> <a href= "http://personal.maths.surrey.ac.uk/st/M.Wolf/" >Martin Wolf </a> from the university of Surrey gave a short introductory course on Twistor theory at Heriot-Watt from 27/11/17-30/11/17. The lectures contained many exercises and some of us spent some time solving them. The exercises and our sketch solutions are <a href= "https://cdross1.github.io/notes/twistor_exercises.pdf"> here<a>.
	<li>Some  <a href= "https://cdross1.github.io/notes/monopoles_and_spectral_curves.pdf"> notes</a> on Monopoles, mini-twistors and spectral curves that I made ( am still making) while reading papers about the topics so that I could keep some conventions to hand. </li>
